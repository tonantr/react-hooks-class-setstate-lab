# Class Component State and Events Lab

## Learning Goals

- Refactor a function component with `useState` to a class component
- Handle events in class components using arrow functions

## Instructions

In this lab is the working code from a previous lesson, using function
components. If you run the tests now, they should all pass, except for the tests
checking that you are using class components instead of functions. Your goal is
to refactor all the components in the `src/components` directory to use classes
instead of functions, and _still_ have the tests passing.

Start by familiarizing yourself with the code and the functionality, then work
through each component and convert them to class components.

Make sure to pay attention to syntax (and in particular, `this` and arrow
functions). Also make sure you are initializing and setting state correctly...
